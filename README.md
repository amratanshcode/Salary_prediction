# Salary Prediction Program

## Overview

This program uses machine learning to predict the salary of an individual based on various factors like years of experience and education level. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict a person's salary using features such as experience and education. In this example, we'll use a simple linear regression model.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning and regression models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization (optional).
